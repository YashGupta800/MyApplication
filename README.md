NewsApp

**Features** :<br/>
* Fetches news from https://newsapi.org/<br/>
* Contains recent news headline,summary and author name.<br/>
* Read the full news by clicking on click here text.<br/>

What I have learnt from this project:
* Making connection with the url.
* working with APIs.
* Fetching Json data and parsing it.
* Making a custom ArrayAdapter for the listview to display the news.
